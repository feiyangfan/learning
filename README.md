### General
* **Consistency**: One of the most **IMPORTANT** thing in development. Make sure when developing, keep everything clean, easy to navigate. Use symbols, styles, comments, etc.. in a consistent manner. That is, do not use different things for the same problem, use one style and stick to it. Another reason is that it is easy to understand for later reviews
