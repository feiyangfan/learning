### General: 
* **Consistency**: One of the most **IMPORTANT** thing in development. Make sure when developing, keep everything clean, easy to navigate. Use symbols, styles, comments, etc.. in a consistent manner. That is, do not use different things for the same problem, use one style and stick to it. Another reason is that it is easy to understand for later reviews  



### [Git notes](./git.md)



## Web development related:
#### npm  
**npm install** to install mising dependencies in package.json.  
**npm run "script"** to run script in package.json.  
**npm build** a script that is used to build that we can test out/release

#### Development 
1. Code split: split codes to several files, and only send js that required to display on current screen to users. Use state management. [Link](https://youtu.be/bb6RCrDaxhw)
2. Some notes: see [notes I took when develop my-daily-planner](https://github.com/feiyangfan/my-daily-planner)
3. Frontend: React
4. Backend: Express
5. Database: Relational(SQL) vs document-oriented database(NoSQL)
