# Java Learning Notes

## Basic Ideas
* In Java, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the **.java** extension. Those source files are then compiled into **.class** files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine1 (Java VM). The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
